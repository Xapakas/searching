    <h1>My Cause: Long-Term Happiness</h1>
    <div class="data1">
    <h2>Dataset 1: World Happiness Report</h2>
    <p>Below are three datasets from the World Happiness Report, which scores happiness side by side with (possibly) related factors, such as economy, health, and freedom.</p>
    <a href="2015.csv" download>2015</a>
    <br>
    <a href="2016.csv" download>2016</a>
    <br>
    <a href="2017.csv" download>2017</a>
    <p>I hope to explore correlations between reported happiness and other statistical factors within countries. This will allow me to see what factors are actually related to happiness at large. For example: Is family (an included variable) vital for happiness? Is health? What about wealth? I can explore all of these questions with this dataset.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="data2">
    <h2>Dataset 2: Subjective Personal Well-being</h2>
    <p>This dataset zooms in a bit more. On the scale of cities (in the UK), it asks respondents a few questions relating to their personal happiness, such as "Do you feel like the things you do in your life are worthwhile?" and "Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?" Using this dataset, I can analyze how those factors relate to respondents' self-reported happiness score.</p>
